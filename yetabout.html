<p class="tealHeader "> Our Story </p>
<div class="flexbox">
  <p class="commonText " style="max-width:600px; padding-right:20px;">Yet Analytics' story begins in Baltimore where five Johns Hopkins denizens with backgrounds in learning science, experiential education, and instructional technology linked up to build an app to measure and provide certification for informal learning. Very quickly they failed. But the reason they failed was due to technical limitations. When they took a deeper look at these technical problems, they realized that a solution to their own problem could provide a more impactful benefit to everyone in the learning and training space than the original app ever could. And so Yet Analytics was born in November of 2014.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="commonText " style="max-width:600px; padding-right:20px;">Today, Yet's technology and expertise is at the core of the Data Analytics and Visualization Environment effort at the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative at the US Department of Defense. Our software powers the learning ecosystems of Fortune 500 companies and large educational institutions. We are recognized experts in the space of xAPI and modern learning technologies and we actively participate and provide thought leadership within global standards activity at the IEEE. Our team's command of knowledge regarding data technologies provides guidance to leading international organizations. And we're still proudly based in Baltimore, just two-and-a-half blocks north of the Inner Harbor.</p>
